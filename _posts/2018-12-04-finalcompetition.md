## Final Competition
After spending hours upon hours in lab, we were very excited on competition day to see our robot compete.

Our robot competed in rounds 1 and 2 during the ECE 3400 Competition during [Cornell Robotics Day](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/events/robotics-day). Unfortunately, our robot's performance was not what we had expected, and we didn't make it to the round 3 like we had hoped.

We mapped a small portion of the maze (some incorrect wall detections due to other robots and collisions):

We explain why we believe our robot was faulty during the competition in our [final robot design](https://pulse-3400.github.io/aboutus/finaldesign.html).

**Congrats to [Team Angry](https://ece3400team28.github.io/website/), who won the competition!**

Despite the outcome of the competition, we were happy to have built a successful intelligent physical system, learned a lot of new things, and enjoyed working with each other. **Thanks to Professor Petersen and all of the TAs who helped us build a robot!**
