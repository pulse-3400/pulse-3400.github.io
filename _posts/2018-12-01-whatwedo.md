Throughout the Fall 2018 semester, we created a robot that could:

* Navigate a maze
* Start when a 660 Hz noise is detected
* Use sensors to follow lines and detect walls
* Avoid other robots using IR detection
* Use depth first search and path planning algorithm to determine how to navigate through the maze
* Communicate using radios to update a GUI 
* Detect treasures using image processing

Final robot cost:

### Modifications to Final Robot Design

#### Better Maze-Solving Algorithm

#### Mechanics
While iteratively testing our robot in the maze, we learned several things about the mechanics of our robot. First, our robot was a little bit top heavy from the two batteries and large breadboard on its top tier. 
- weight bearing towards bottoms
- perfboarding everything/making a shield

#### Speed vs Searching Algorithm Tradeoff
- How our larger wheels didn't work out for us

#### Debugging
- LED indicators

### Ideas for Future Improvements
- Schmitt triggers to make line sensors digital inputs
