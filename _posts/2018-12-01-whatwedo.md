Throughout this project, we constantly updated the design of our robot to fit criteria of the competition. 

Our final robot can:

* Navigate a maze
* Start when a 660 Hz noise is detected
* Use sensors to follow lines and detect walls
* Avoid other robots using IR detection
* Use depth first search to determine which node to visit next
* Communicate using radios to update a GUI 
* Detect treasures using image processing
