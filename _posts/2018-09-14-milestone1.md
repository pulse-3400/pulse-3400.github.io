### Objective
The main goal of this milestone is to have the robot follow a line and to have the robot successfully traverse the grid in a figure eight.

### Procedure

#### Integrating Sensors and Following a Line
We decided to use three QTR-1 line sensors to have our robot to detect lines on the ground. The line sensors were placed in line next to each other, about one centimeter apart.

Since the line sensors are infrared sensors that record greyscale values from 0 to 1000, we set our threshold value to be 400 to tell when the sensor is on or off the line. Line sensors that outputted values less than 400 were on the line, and line sensors that outputted values greater than or equal to 400 were off the line. 

The line sensors were able to detect if the robot was on the line based off of the following diagram:

The robot detected and followed the line based off of the following logic:
* Case 1: If the middle sensor outputted a value less than 400 (sensor on line) and the left and right sensors outputted values greater than 400 (sensors off line), then the robot was straight on the line and could move forwards.
* Case 2: If the right sensor outputted a value less than 400 (sensor on line) and the middle and left sensors outputted values greater than 400 (sensors off line), then the robot was aligned too far to the left, and small corrections needed to be made to recenter the robot on the line.
* Case 3: If the left sensor outputted a value less than 400 (sensor on line) and the middle and right sensors outputted values greater than 400 (sensors off line), then the robot was aligned too far to the right, and small corrections needed to be made to recenter the robot on the line.
* Case 4: If all three sensors outputted values less than 400, then the robot had reached an intersection.

Understanding these cases eased us into writing code to make the robot follow a line.

### State Machine Explanation

</p>
The state machine's "default" state is state 0, where it is travelling straight along one of the white lines. From there, it has two basic course correction states, states 1 and 2, which will correct for the robot veering right or left, respectively. These states use functions called correctLeft() and correctRight(), which work by accelerating the outside wheel if it is not already at full speed, or reducing the speed of the inside wheel otherwise. Though the precision of this controller algorithm is limited with the current sensor setup, the correction functions do feature configurable gains that we have used to minimize overcorrection.<br/>
Any of states 0, 1, or 2 can transition to state 3, which occurs when the robot reaches a cross in the lines. From here, it will progress directly to state 4, where it stops at the cross. The machine will set a variable high indicating that it is waiting for a command, which currently either tells it to turn right or left, but will also allow the robot to continue straight in later versions. Once the robot receives a turning command, it will proceed to states 5 and 6 for a right turn, or states 7 and 8 for a left turn. The pairs of states contain intermediate conditions that the robot must meet while it makes its turn, including expected line patterns and minimum durations. Once the robot completes either state 6 or 8 and has finished the maneuver, it returns to state 0 to continue straight along the selected path, making course adjustments as necessary.<br/>
States 9 through 11 are intended to allow the robot to return to the lines in the case that it is completely off course (all three sensors are seeing a dark surface). They are not currently tuned as well as the other states, but this has not been an issue as the other states have proven completely effective at keeping the robot on the white lines. When starting the robot off of the course, they work with reasonable consistency. They will be further improved in the future for robustness' sake.
