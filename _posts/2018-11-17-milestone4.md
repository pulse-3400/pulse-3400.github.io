### Objective
The goal of this milestone is to fully implement the image processor so it can detect whether or not there is a treasure, what color the treasure is, and what shape the treasure is.

### Implementation
To implement the image processor, we expanded our basic image processor from lab 4. At the end of lab 4, we were able to detect whether or not there is a treasure and what color the treasure was. To determine the shape, we took pixels from the top, middle and bottom of the image and pixels from the left, center, and right of the image. We compared these pixels to eachother to determine the shape.

One issue we encountered was that we could not write directly to the registers because the code would not compile. To fix this, we used temporary registers to store the value of the pixel and then we transferred these values to the actual registers. 

Here is a video of the image processor with a red triangle, red square, red diamond, blue triangle, blue square, and blue diamond.
