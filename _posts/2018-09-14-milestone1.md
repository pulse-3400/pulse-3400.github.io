### Objective
The main goal of this milestone is to have the robot follow a line and to have the robot successfully
traverse the grid in a figure eight.

### Procedure

#### Hardware Modifications
We began by attaching line sensors to our robot. After testing, we realized that the sensors worked the best when they 
were closer to the surface, so we attached them a few millimeters from the ground. Our initial design was with two 
sensors attached to the front sides of the robot to detect when the robot reaches a cross section and one sensor in the 
back to detect when the robot has finished turning. After testing, we realized that a more practical design would be to 
have all three sensors in the front to allow for better corrections when the robot goes off of the line and to allow for 
better sensing of when the robot should turn. With this setup, the two outer sensors could sense when the robot was off 
of the line and also when it had reached a cross section. 

#### Software Modifications
Since the line sensors are infrared sensors that record greyscale values from 0 to 1000, we set our threshold value to be 400 to tell when the
