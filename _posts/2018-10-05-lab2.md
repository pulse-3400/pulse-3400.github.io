### Objective
The purpose of this lab is to add sensors to our robot and to make analog circuits and a digital filter to interface with the Arduino. The two sensors are a microphone circuit and an IR sensor. The microphone circuit will detect a 660 Hz whistle blow signifying the beginning of the maze mapping. The circuit with the IR sensor will capture inputs from the sensor to detect nearby robots emitting IR at 6.08 kHz and distinguish them from decoys emitting IR at 18 kHz.

### Procedure
We split up into two teams, the acoustic team and the optic team, and progressed through the lab as follows:

#### Materials Used
The acoustic team used the following materials:
* 1 Arduino Uno
* Electret microphone
* 1 µF capacitor
* 300 Ω resistors
* ~3 kΩ resistor
* Various other components, as needed

The optical team used the following materials:
* 1 Arduino Uno
* IR transistor (OP598)
* 1 IR hat
* 1 IR decoy
* Various other components, as needed

### Acoustic Team 
#### Assembling the Microphone
Our first step was assembling the basic microphone circuit on the lab 2. The output of the circuit went to analog input A0. Our circuit was assembled according to the lab instructions:

</p>

Next, we added the Open Music Lab FFT library to our Arduino IDE. We then the example script fft_adc_serial. In short, fft_adc_serial processes the signal into pin A0 using an FFT and sends it over the serial port.

The FFT algorithm samples a signal over a period of time and divides the signal into its frequency components. In this case, the signal is range of voltages into analog pin A0. Below is the graph when we generated a 660 Hz tone using an iPhone app into the microphone circuit.
