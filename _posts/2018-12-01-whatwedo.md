Throughout this project, we constantly updated the design of our robot to fit criteria of the competition. We document the design of our robot here.

Our final robot can:

* Navigate a maze
* Start when a 660 Hz noise is detected
* Use sensors to follow lines and detect walls
* Avoid other robots using IR detection
* Use depth first search to determine which node to visit next
* Communicate using radios to update a GUI 
* Detect treasures using image processing

### Modifications

#### Mechanical Robustness
While iteratively testing our robot in the maze, we learned several things about the mechanics of our robot. First, our robot was a little bit top heavy from the two batteries and large breadboard on its top tier. 

### Ideas for Future Improvements
