### Objective
The purpose of this milestone was to create improve our robot's right-hand wall following algorithm to some sort of an algorithm that allows it to more effciently and quickly explore a maze. By the completion of this milestone, our robot explored a maze by prioriting intersections that it hadn't visited before, and visiting those intersections. However, we have written a DFS algorithm (that we are currently implementing on our robot) and will document its progress here.

### Design
After deciding that we wanted to implement a DFS algorithm for our robot, we broke down the creation of the algorithm into intermediate steps to ensure that our robot would have some sort of working, optimized algorithm in the following order:

1) Turn-by-turn with wall avoidance (completed)

2) Turn-by-turn with wall avoidance and priority on unvisited locations (completed)

3) DFS through a maze with no walls (completed)

4) Full DFS with wall avoidance (work in progress)
